## Specifications

###EDUCATION PLATFORM (GOOGLE CLASSROOM.COM)

There are 3 types of users - students, teachers, mentors and admins. Students need to register with a school provided email. The Admin sets the email to i.e. @ius.edu.ba or @bitcamp.ba. Students need to provide their first and last name, email (as specified above), Skype name, links to their social network presence and a profile picture (optional). Students can request access to one or more courses. Access is granted or denied by either the course teacher or the Admin.

Students need to see their upcoming assignments and the materials shared by the teachers. When doing an assignment, students need to mark it as “started”. The mentor needs to be notified once his student has started a new assignment. Once the student finishes the assignment the mentor needs to get another notification. Once the assignment is submitted by the student, both the teacher and the mentor should be able to leave a comment. Assignments in general should have a description, due date and related resources (files, links...).

Students are assigned to mentors by the Admin. Mentors leave weekly reports on the student’s progress. If mentors miss the deadline for the weekly report they should be reminded automatically by the system. Mentors have access to the submitted reviews for their current student and can only leave reviews for their current student. The report questions are created by the Admin but will always contain the “week of classes” field which is automatically calculated. Mentors and students should have an on-site way of communication (chat/messages). Once a student has been assigned to a mentor, the mentor is automatically subscribed to the courses the student is subscribed to but can only see class posts marked (by the teachers) as “visible to mentors”.

Teachers are assigned to classes by the Admin. Teachers have access to all the performance reviews for all of the students, can see all the student profiles and communicate with all of the students in their classes. Teachers can post announcements and assignments to the class feed. The announcements/assignments can be set as “visible to mentors”. Teachers should be able to submit daily reports for their lectures. The fields for the daily report are created by the Admin, but are always text-based answers. Every report will contain the date and time of the lecture. Students and Mentors are able to see the course schedule, The course schedule is created by the Admin. A teacher can also be an Admin.
